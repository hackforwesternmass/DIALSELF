  <p align="center" class="PageTitle">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="center" class="ParaHead style3"><strong>October 2006 to February 2009</strong></p>
  <p align="center"><strong>Total Number  of Volunteers: 147</strong><br />
      <strong>Total Number  of Volunteer Hours: 5,700</strong><br />
      <strong>Total Fiscal  Value of RISE Services: $119,000</strong></p>
  <p class="Subhead"><strong>Current  RISE Programming:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Recess  Helpers – </strong>Three community volunteers are currently helping to  supervise the recess periods for 4th and 5th  graders.  One volunteer is a UMass  student and the other two are parents of students at the school.</p>
  <p><strong>Library  Services – </strong>The Greenfield Middle School has extremely limited library  resources.  RISE has recruited and  trained several volunteers to serve in the Library, allowing students to use  the space and check out books.</p>
  <p><strong>Badminton  Club – </strong>David Voegele, Executive Director of DIAL/SELF Youth and  Community Services and a local badminton enthusiast, volunteers to run this  club three days a week.  On Tuesdays and  Thursdays, the club meets in the evenings at the school and is open to the  community.  On Wednesdays, the club meets  after school and is for students only.  </p>
  <p><strong>GCC  PeaceMeal Project – </strong>RISE has partnered with the Peace and  Social Justice Department at Greenfield Community College.  A GCC student visited Social Studies  classrooms and helped students write about peace.  The students’ work is now published in the  GCC publication, PeaceMeal.</p>
  <p><strong>Guest  Performance – </strong>RISE partnered with the Dance  Department at Greenfield Community College.   The GCC troupe, called Mixed Company, came in and did a free performance  for students in grades 4 through 7.</p>
  <p><strong>Community  Service Learning and Creative Writing – </strong>A local high  school student expressed interest in starting two after-school clubs at the  Middle School.  RISE has paired him with  adult volunteers in the community to run both a Community Service Learning club  as well as a Creative Writing Club.   These programs start in January.</p>
  <p><strong>MLK  Day Celebration – </strong>RISE has partnered with the Traprock  Peace Center in Greenfield to offer a special program at the Middle School in  honor of Martin Luther King Jr.  Students  are also preparing art work about MLK to be featured in an exhibit at Traprock on  January 15th, 2009.</p>
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p class="Subhead"><strong>Past  RISE Projects:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Girls Group/ Friends Club - </strong>In its second year, Girls Group  transformed into Friends Club after going co-ed in February. Facilitated by two  vounteers, this group enjoyed a variety of activities in and around Greenfield.  Once a month, the club went to the Youth Center to cook dinner with each other.  Other outings included trips to the library, Poet Seat Tower and the Federal  Street School playground, walks around town, arts and crafts, playing various  ball games in the gymnasium, bowling, sledding and hiking. </p>
  <p><strong>Guest Readers Program -</strong> This was another returning program.  Jason Schneider, a 6th grade Language Arts teacher, hosted community  visitors in his classroom and invited them to read to his students. Jason hoped  to demonstrate the idea that everyone reads. Mayor Christine Forgey, Mike Fritz  of Rugg Lumber, and Greg Aubin from the school committee were the Guest Readers  this year. </p>
  <p><strong>Fashion Design Club -</strong> During a conversation with six fifth  grade girls about leaving school early to go to the mall, this club was born.  The RISE Resource Coordinator set up an after  school group in which these girls could explore the art of fashion design.  Activities included design sketching,  creating unique t-shirt patterns, discussing current fashion trends and an end  of year trip to the Holyoke Mall. </p>
  <p><strong>Life Skills Class Field Trips - </strong>Suzanne Schropfer’s Life Skills class  visited various community locations during the school year. She partnered with  the RISE Resource Coordinator, who did outreach to set up trips to the  Greenfield Public Library and Baystate Franklin Medical Center. At the library,  students learned about how books were arranged on the shelves and about how to  search for a book on the library computers. They also heard about the various  perks of having a library card, including the free passes to a number of local  museums. At Baystate Franklin Medical Center, students visited the laboratory  and learned about the phlebotomist profession. They also got a chance to see  bacteria under a microscope and learned effective ways to wash their hands. Bob  Manners, from Baystate Ambulance Services, also came to GMS to talk about what  he does as an EMT and to show the students around the ambulance. </p>
  <p><strong>Badminton Club -</strong> Back for a second year, David  Voegele’s Badminton Club yielded twenty participants of various ages. This club  started during the winter months and was open to anyone interested in playing  badminton. The club met on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the evenings.</p>
  <p><strong>Flex II Volunteers - </strong>(Flex II is an enrichment block built  into the school day through the Expanded Learning Time Grant) Elle Blake and  Chris Paton, from GCC, volunteered their time during their spring semester to  help with Flex II offerings. Elle, a Social Justice student, assisted with the ‘Go  Green’ Flex II group. Chris, a Theater student, helped with the production of  GMS’s spring play, <em>The Phantom Tollbooth</em>.  After a casting shortage at the last minute, Chris stepped in as the lead role!  Cassie Walker also volunteered during Flex II. She co-lead a knitting class for  5th and 6th graders. Karen Rain lead a Flex II group  called ‘Fitness and Fun’, where she taught students about yoga and other  physical games geared to build strength in body and mind.</p>
  <p><strong>Pioneer Valley Symphony Orchestra  (PVSO)-</strong> Through a  partnership with RISE, Connie Clarke from the PVSO donated a number of tickets  to GMS for students to attend three concerts during the school year. A member  of the GMS staff volunteered to recruit and transport students to these  concerts, providing them an opportunity to experience the hard work and  dedication that these performers give to their instruments.  Five musicians from the PVSO also came into  the Middle School to perform a concert during an all-school assembly.  The performance featured a young clarinetist  who really engaged the students and offered a special workshop for students  clarinetists in the GMS Band.</p>
  <p><strong>Field Trip Chaperone – </strong>Upon the request of the 6th  grade teachers, the RISE Resource Coordinator served as a chaperone for a field  trip to the UMass Fine Arts Center.</p>
  <p><strong>Northfield Mount Hermon School’s  Community Service Day/April Vacation Fun Day - </strong>For the first time, NMH collaborated  with local schools’ 5th and 6th grades to provide them  with a fun, active and free day of sports and games on the NMH campus. Junior  students from NMH facilitated this event, offering such activities as capture  the flag, frisbee golf, badminton, button making, sidewalk chalk drawing,  scavenger hunts and relay races. RISE coordinated transportation and  supervision for 10 students from GMS to attend this fun day.</p>
  <p><strong>8th Grade Career Fair -</strong> In its second year, the Career Fair  yielded many returning presenters as well as some new faces. This fair was held  to give 8th graders an idea of some career options in the Greenfield  area. This year’s presenters were: Rugg Lumber and Building Solutions, the Greenfield  Fire Department, Baystate Franklin Medical Center, Foster’s Supermarket, The  Greenfield Recorder, the Greenfield Recreation Department and the Greenfield  Youth Center.</p>
  <p><strong>Girls Hui –</strong> This girls group met once a week to  engage in fun and cooperative activities as well as talk about the issues that  were most important to the participants.   The word 'hui' means 'together' in the native language of their Hawaiian  group leader, Marisa Costello.  Marisa is  an AmeriCorps member and a youth-worker at CommunityAction! Youth  Programs.  </p>
  <p><strong>Dance Club -</strong> The Dance Club was started completely  by student initiative.  Six girls from  the 6th grade participated in this once a week after-school club  with an adult volunteer.  They performed  at three different community events.   Their dance moves came mainly from hip-hop and Latin traditions.</p>
  <p><strong>Rock Band</strong> – Steve Fleury, one of the custodians  at the Greenfield Middle School, expressed interest in volunteering to lead an  after-school rock band.  He approached  the RISE Resource Coordinator and the two worked together to set up the  group.  Five students participated in the  band.  They had two public performances  during the school year.<br />
      <strong>                          </strong><br />
      <strong>One-on-One Readers</strong> – RISE recruited three volunteers to  work one-on-one with students in need of extra help with literacy skills.  The students met with their helpers twice a  week during the school year.</p>
  <p><strong>Guest Readers</strong> – Mr. Jason Schneider, a 6th  grade Language Arts teacher, asked if RISE could bring some guest readers in to  visit his class.  A guest reader came in  every Monday to read to the students and talk a bit about who they are in the  community.  Guest readers have included  Mayor Christine Forgey, Superintendent  Joe Ruscio, School Committee Member David  Westbrook, Firefighter Jan Holey, GCC Professor Abbie Jenks, Financial Advisor  Mark Kurber, CEO of Rugg Lumber Mike Fritz, as well as several parents who have  come to be guest readers in their child’s classroom.</p>
  <p><strong>Owning Up</strong> – Owning Up is an anti-bullying  curriculum designed to foster a sense of dignity and self-worth amongst the  students.  RISE identified and recruited  four trained  facilitators to come in and  work with 7th grade health classes.   The facilitators represented a range of social agencies in the area.</p>
  <p><strong>Badminton</strong> – David Voegele, Executive Director  of Dial/Self, volunteered to lead an after-school badminton program.  There were about 10 students consistently  involved in this program all throughout the winter season.  </p>
  <p><strong>Art Club</strong> – Melinda McCreven, a local artist and  art therapist, volunteered to do an after-school art program once a week.  She brought all of her own supplies and a  variety of exciting projects to the program.  </p>
  <p><strong>Woodshop</strong> – Cathy Marcum, a member of the PTO,  volunteered to run an after-school woodshop program once a week.  RISE secured a donation from Rugg Lumber of  all of the wood and nails for the woodshop projects.  Cathy brought in all of her own tools, and  the students used the school’s safety gear.   Projects included a birdhouse, a carpenter’s tote, a coat rack and a  shelf.</p>
  <p><strong>CPR/First Aid Course</strong> – Joy Pelc, a nurse at Franklin  Medical Center and a member of the PTO, expressed interest in bringing a  CPR/First Aid Course to the Greenfield Middle School.  Through collaboration with Amy Swisher from  Franklin Medical Center, RISE was able to bring the course in at little to no  cost to the participants.  Fourteen  students took advantage of this opportunity and received certificates in  CPR/First Aid Awareness.</p>
  <p><strong>Guest Performers</strong> – At a staff meeting in the beginning  of the year several of the teachers lamented the lack of resources to bring  cultural enrichment to the school.  RISE  organized three guest performances at no cost to the school.  Performers included a local rock band, an  international clown, and a college dance troupe.</p>
  <p><strong>Theater Enrichment during Advisory</strong> – Jill Morgan, a student in the Theater  Department at GCC, volunteered to work with two of our 8th grade  advisory groups.  She came in twice a  week and brought in cooperative theater games for the group to play.  Both teachers that she worked with commented  on her ability to get the students to take risks.  They were so happy to have her on board.</p>
  <p><strong>Youth Opportunities Fair</strong> – This event tool place on May 31st  during the school day.  It was an  opportunity for youth-service providers to come into the school and promote  their summer programs.  The goal was to  make the students more aware of and excited about the many opportunities to  engage in out-of-school time programming.   This fair also allowed the Middle School to open its doors to community  partners and forge relationships with organizations and agencies that work to  benefit the students.</p>
  <p><strong>Career Fair</strong> – On June 5th, the Middle  School held a career fair for the 8th graders.  RISE identified and recruited employers from  a variety of fields to speak to the students about what they do and what they  look for in a young applicant.  This gave  the 8th graders a glance at the working world before they went on to  High School. </p>
